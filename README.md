* I gathered data('key qualification' and 'responsibilites') on 'digital marketer' and 'UI/UX designer' in case those two job positions turn out to be better match.
* ...with preprocessing all done, the model is set to answer my question. 
* Then, All I need to do is type my competencies or personality either in words or full sentences, and check recommended job among 'data scientist', 'digital marketer', and 'UI/UX designer'.
